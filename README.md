# EnergyDashboard
The version of the dashboard published on [render.com](https://energy-dashboard-293u.onrender.com/) is suuuper slow. It can take a few minutes to load the website and to update every interactive feature. So if you select something and nothing happens it is normal. Take a coffee and come back in a few minutes. Then it will have updated
## Run the app

```console
foo@bar:DashBoard_Folder$ python3 app.py
```
